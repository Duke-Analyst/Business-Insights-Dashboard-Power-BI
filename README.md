# I. Introduction
### 1. The request
The senior manager wants to understand the companyâ€™s business performance to develop market expansion strategies and make informed decisions about strategic product selection

### 2. The idea
In response to the senior manager's request, I have created 3 dashboards:

- Overview Dashboard: Summarizes the overall business performance, including revenue trends, growth rates, and key operational metrics. To help the manager 

- Product Analysis Dashboard: Focuses on detailed product performance, identifying top-performing products and highlighting areas for potential strategic investment.

- Region Analysis Dashboard: Provides a regional breakdown of sales and market trends, allowing for a clearer understanding of geographical performance and expansion opportunities.

These dashboards equip the senior manager with the essential data to guide market expansion strategies and select high-priority products for growth.

### 3. Dataset
The data includes:

- Return Status: Details whether specific orders were returned, recorded with 'Yes' or 'No' indicators alongside each unique Order ID (table 'Returned').

- Regional Personnel Information: Contains names and assigned regions of key personnel, covering various geographic areas such as Central, North Asia, Africa, and more (table 'People').

- Order Details: Comprehensive transactional data, including Order ID, order and shipping dates, customer details, shipping mode, product category and sub-category, sales, quantity, and profit, broken down by regions, markets, and specific product attributes (table 'Order ID').

# Part B: The Dashboards & Insights
## Overview
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f0ee957-26f6-4a75-a786-3dda08c2e561)

Insights:
- Total Sales: The company achieved 3,213K USD in sales.
- Profitability: Total profit stands at 370K USD with a 12% Return on Sales (ROS), suggesting relatively thin margins.
- Product Returns: There is a 5% return rate, resulting in 2K units returned. This returned rate is low, indicating effective sales or product quality management.
- Seasonal Profit Trends: Profit steadily increased through the quarters, with the highest in Q4, hinting at potential seasonal demand or effective end-of-year promotions.
## Product Analysis

Top Performing Products (Profit Earned):
- Phones (427K), Copiers (405K), and Bookcases (381K) generate the highest profits, making them key contributors to the company's bottom line.
- These products represent the company's core profitable items, suggesting they are well-established in the market.

Returned Products (Profit Lost):
- Appliances, Bookcases, and Phones have the highest returns, with Appliances and Bookcases contributing 42K and 38K in lost sales.
- Office Supplies have a high return rate (46.9%) among returned products, highlighting an area for improvement in quality control or customer satisfaction in this category.
## Region Analysis
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ce238a4-4100-44a4-8b30-c351523256c2)

- The top-performing regions are APAC (23.33%), LATAM (21.99%), and US (21.31%).
- Africa and Canada have low sales and quantity numbers. There may be market challenges, or these markets may lack targeted marketing.

# Part C: Recommendation
## 1. Strategic product selection
- Phones and Copiers have the highest sales and likely high-profit margins. Expanding markets for these products could lead to significant revenue growth.
- Chairs could be secondary choices for market expansion because of its low returned quantity

## 2. Strategic Regional Expansion and Market Focus
- Prioritize High-Performing Regions for Expansion: APAC, LATAM, and the US are the top-performing regions. Increase market presence through localized marketing campaigns, partnerships, or improved distribution channels in these regions to maximize revenue.
- Africa and Canada currently show low performance. Conduct a feasibility study in these regions to understand demand, competitor landscape, and customer preferences.

**Furthermore:**
- Seasonal Campaigns and Promotions: Capitalize on the Q4 profit increase by implementing promotional strategies in other quarters to balance sales throughout the year.
- Reduce Product Return Rate: Reducing returns in categories like Appliances and Office Supplies could save 37K in lost profit, improving overall profitability.
